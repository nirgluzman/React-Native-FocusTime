## Padding vs. Margin

- `Margin` is the space around an element. It is used to move an element up or down on a page as
  well as left or right.
- Margins are used when you need to adjust the spacing between elements.

- `Padding` is the space between the element and the related content inside it. It determines how
  elements look and sit within a container.
- Padding is used if we want to create a space between an element and the edge of the container or
  the border.
